# Dublin, Ireland Blog
Spring 2024

View the site here: https://aidancarr1.github.io/Blog/

This blog uses HTML and Javascript to read JSON files, and output blog posts. Posts consist of different elements like photos, captions, paragraphs, music widgets, and fun facts. The site has some basic CSS and accessibility features for my grandparents.

I started this personal project while studying abroad at _Dublin City University_.
This website was originally set up to share pictures and stories with my family back home, while giving me a fun coding challenge.
