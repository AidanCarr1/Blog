# Dublin, Ireland Blog
Spring 2024

This blog uses HTML and Javascript to read JSON files, and output blog posts. Posts consist of different elements like photos, captions, paragraphs, music widgets, and fun facts.

I started this personal project while studying abroad at _Dublin City University_.
This website was originally set up to share pictures and stories with my family back home, while giving me a fun coding challenge.
